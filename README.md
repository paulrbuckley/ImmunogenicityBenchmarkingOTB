# ImmunogenicityBenchmarking
Here, we proviide data and scripts to generate main figures in the manuscript.

## Figure 1: Model Benchmarking
- OTB_Test_Models_CoV_2.rmd generates Figs 1A-B, as well as corresponding supplementary panels for S1.
- OTB_Test_Models_NEOAG_GBM.rmd generates Fig 1C as well as panels from supplementary S2.
- OTB_Test_Models_NEOAG_TESLA.rmd generates Fig 1D as well as panels from supplementary S3. 

## Figure 2: Differences in features associated with pathogen vs. cancer peptide immunogenicity
- Problems_Diff_Features_Path_Cancer_6_1.rmd generates panels from Figure 2.

## Figure 3
